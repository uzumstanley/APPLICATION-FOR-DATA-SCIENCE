# Image processing and feature extraction for plant disease detection from stem images

This code is implemented from scratch for extracting disease affected portions from images of Jute Plant Stems. Different image processing methods like Hue-based Segmentation, Morphological Analysis (i.e. erosion, dilation etc.), Blob Detection, Largest Connected Component, Color co-occurrence methodology, Texture Analysis etc. are implemented and applied. Extracted features are used for Jute Plant Disease Detection using Multi-class Support Vector Machine.
